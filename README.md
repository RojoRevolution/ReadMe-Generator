## :zap: Installation
To get started, simply download all all files onto your machine. You will need to install the Inquirer module from NPM. See example below.
> npm install inquirer 

## :zap: Usage
Once everything is downloaded and installed, simply run the index.js file FROM the directory you'd like to create the ReadMe file for. Note: The index.js file does not need to be housed in the same directory you are working in, you just simply call the entire path to the file.
> node ~/directory_name/ReadMe-Generator/index.js
